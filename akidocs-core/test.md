# Hello *World* **2**

One might wonder why we have a test Markdown file **here** at akidocs-core and at repository root. Worry not I have an answer **for you guys. *Because* it's rather** **convenient** to have quick test files at two different places for quick reproducable testing. 2

## *Second heading 2*

*Another paragraph here. 2*

## **Third heading 2**  #####

## Composable styles test

This has ***bold and italic*** together.

This has **bold with *nested italic* inside**.

This has *italic with **nested bold** inside*.

## Soft break test

This line has a single newline
so it should join with a space and flow as one paragraph.

## Hard break test

This line has two trailing spaces  
so it should break here and start a new line.

This line has five trailing spaces     
which should also produce a hard break.

## Multiple hard breaks

Line one  
Line two  
Line three

## Mixed soft and hard breaks

Soft break here
continues on same line, but hard break here  
starts a new line, then soft again
all one paragraph.

## Hard break with styles

*Italic line one*  
*Italic line two*

**Bold line one**  
**Bold line two**

## Hard break at end of paragraph ignored

These trailing spaces at the end of a paragraph do nothing special.
